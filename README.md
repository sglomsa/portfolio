# Simen Glomså - Portfolio

Hello, I am Simen Glomså!

I am 17 years old and I come from Kristiansand, Norway. I am a student at
**Tangen videregående skole**, in the **VG2 Informasjonsteknologi** study.
Currently, I'm looking for apprenticeship positions with IT-Development.

This is a portfolio of various projects I have done. Both from school and
personal projects I am doing in my free time.

## Projects

### Cydead - A mod preset manager for Red Dead Redemption 2

This is a personal project I have been working on for the last few weeks.
It is a CLI based tool for managing different presets/profiles of mods
for Red Dead Redemption 2. Its goal is making it simple and reliable
to use multiple presets of mods, and giving freedom to the user.

The project is currently still in development,
but it will soon enter an alpha stage.

### Norkart

During a practicum period, I was lucky enough to spend two weeks at Norkart.
I worked on a Python script for fetching documents from a
REST-API. These documents would then be processed, and sensitive information
would be removed. I am restricted by an NDA, so I cannot provide the source code
or provide much more information about it.

[Me and my partner have been praised for the work we did,
and I am glad I got the opportunity to take part in Norkart's
plan for a future with AI.](https://www.digin.no/nyheter/erfaringer/)

### Neutrai - A tool for neutralizing training data

In the last few years, AI development has skyrocketed. I believe that overall,
AI will be the center of the 21st century. However, with great power comes
great resposibility.

We recently had an exciting group project at school about AI. The goal was to
showcase a problem which we could use AI to solve.

My group's pitch was for a concept about an AI tool that would ensure AI
would remain ethical and fair for all. Essentially, it was a tool that would
scan through training data for an AI, and then process it based on the context,
removing biased data in that training set.

Although our pitch was mostly a proof of concept, I am still convinced this
would be a revolutionary tool for ensuring the AI of the future would be unbiased.

My main focus was creating the backend technology for this.

### Pong & Brickle

This was a game I made in Unity a while back. It is essentially just two games -
Pong and Brickle/Brickbreaker, and you can switch between them easily. The reason
I made this was I wanted to create a game in Unity without basing it on tutorials
like I had done with an earlier game.

[The project won an award at IM Award 2023 (An award show for the IT and Media
division of the school)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfJtgrZHGw)

The game can be played [here](https://sarlude.itch.io/pong-brickle)

### Educational Phishing

In the modern age, it's easy to get fooled and get your data stolen, install malware,
get your password leaked, etc. Our class recently took the initiative to try to educate
people about phishing, through the means of phishing.

We created a poster imitating a
McDonalds reward system, encouraing people to scan the QR Code on it.
This would show them a login site imitating McDonalds' site.
If the user then tried to login with their info, it would
redirect them to a page with information on phishing
and what we coul have done if we had malicous intent.
